**myFirstQuad** - Draws Quad. Example of Element Buffer usage, which stores triangle vertex indeces.

**triangleRGB** - Color Interpolation in Fragment Shader.

**textures** - Plane texturing.

**translations** - Plane translations.

**coordinateSystems** - Simple MVP.

**coordinateSystems2** - A pile of rotating boxes.

**camera** - Rotates Boxes and Camera.

**viewer** - Model viewer based on all previous tasks. Foundation for experiments with lightning.
